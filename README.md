# Natural Language Processing

Course Natural Language Processing - Ben-Gurion University for B.sc And M.sc students.

# Assignment1 Objective:
The objectives of this assignment are:

1) Use Python for Machine Learning applications
2) Access an annotated text corpus using NLTK corpus classes
3) Annotate and extend a text corpus
4) Access text resources on the Internet and clean it before it can be annotated
5) Explore the statistical properties of a corpus
6) Train and evaluate simple tagging models
7) Experiment with a good POS tagger.
8) Experiment with a neural network library.


# Assignment2 + Project  Objective:
This assignment covers the topic of sequence classification, word embeddings and RNNs.
The tasks on which we experiment are Named Entity Recognition (NER) and document classification.
The objective is:

1) Learn the HMM model and the Viterbi algorithm.
2) Experiment and evaluate classifiers for the tasks of named entity recognition and document classification.
3) Use pre-trained word embeddings and measure whether they help for the task of NER and Document Classification.
4) Experiment with LSTM document encoding using the Keras library with pre-trained word embeddings.
